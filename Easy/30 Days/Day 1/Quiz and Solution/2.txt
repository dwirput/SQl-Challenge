Consider a table orders with the following schema:

Column Name	Data Type
order_id	integer
customer_id	integer
order_date	date
order_total	decimal
order_status	text
Here's a sample dataset:

order_id	customer_id	order_date	order_total	order_status
1	100	2022-03-01	123.45	Shipped
2	101	2022-03-01	678.90	Cancelled
3	102	2022-03-02	234.56	Shipped
4	103	2022-03-02	789.01	Delivered
5	100	2022-03-03	345.67	Shipped
6	101	2022-03-03	890.12	Delivered
7	102	2022-03-04	456.78	Cancelled
8	103	2022-03-04	12.34	Shipped
9	100	2022-03-05	567.89	Delivered
10	101	2022-03-05	123.45	Shipped
Here are the questions for the SQL challenge:

Write an SQL query to retrieve the order ID and total amount of orders that were shipped.

Write an SQL query to retrieve the customer IDs of customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days.

Write an SQL query to calculate the average order total of orders that were delivered.

Write an SQL query to find the total revenue generated by all orders that were cancelled

solution
1
SELECT
	orders.order_id,
	orders.order_total 
FROM
	orders 
WHERE
	orders.order_status = 'shipped'


2.
SELECT DISTINCT
	orders.customer_id 
FROM
	orders 
WHERE
	orders.order_date < '2023-03-05'


3.
SELECT DISTINCT
	AVG(orders.order_total)
FROM
	orders 
WHERE
	orders.order_status = 'delivered'


4.
SELECT DISTINCT
	SUM(orders.order_total) as total_revenue
FROM
	orders 
WHERE
	orders.order_status = 'cancelled'
