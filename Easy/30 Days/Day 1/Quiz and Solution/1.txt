Consider a table employees with the following schema:

Column Name	Data Type
id	integer
name	text
age	integer
salary	integer
department	text
Here's a sample dataset:

id	name	age	salary	department
1	Alice	28	50000	Sales
2	Bob	35	60000	Marketing
3	Charlie	40	70000	Sales
4	David	25	40000	Engineering
5	Emma	30	55000	Marketing
6	Frank	32	65000	Sales
7	Grace	27	45000	Engineering
8	Henry	38	75000	Marketing
9	Isabelle	45	90000	Sales
10	Jack	29	52000	Engineering



Here are the questions for the SQL challenge:

Write an SQL query to retrieve the names and salaries of employees who work in the Sales department and earn more than 60000.

Write an SQL query to calculate the average age of employees in each department.

Write an SQL query to find the employee with the highest salary.

Write an SQL query to find the names of employees who are older than the average age of all employees.

Good luck with the challenge!
